The market for $ 200 billion of high-risk junk bonds , battered by a *UNKION* of defaults and huge price declines this year , *UNKLY* *UNKED* Friday . STOP

`` The junk bond market is in a state of *UNK* now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. *CUNKS* , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy *UNKED* securities for a new fund . STOP 
This *UNK* is `` far from over , '' he says . STOP 
*CUNK* 's collapse helped *UNK* the *UNK* selling of stocks that produced the *UNKEST* *UNK-* *UNK* in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . STOP 
*CUNKLY* , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the *UNK-* securities they could find . STOP 
But `` an *UNK* *UNK* *UNKED* '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John *CUNK* , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . STOP 
For example , the price of *CUNK* Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due *UNKN* -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar . STOP 
But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of *CUNK* , the owner of the nationwide chain of *UNKN* *UNK* stores that is *UNKED* for cash . STOP 
Goldman officials declined to comment . STOP 
*CUNK* bonds , which *UNKED* from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as *UNKER* after *UNKER* sank *UNK* the weight of hefty interest payments . STOP 
The *UNK* market received its biggest *UNK* last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing . STOP 
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be *UNK* on some interest payments and to put its *OUS* *CUNKS* department-store chain up for sale . STOP 
Now , dozens of corporations , including *CUNK* Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk *UNKS* to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs *UNK* , may never get the money . STOP 
`` The music has stopped playing , '' says Michael *CUNKS* , a principal in the investment firm of Levy *CUNKS* . STOP 
`` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . '' STOP 
In Friday 's aftermath , says R. Douglas *CUNK* , a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward *UNK* could be *UNKED* , depending on the *UNK* . '' STOP 
In August , First Boston withdrew a $ *UNKN* million junk offering of Ohio *CUNKS* bonds because potential buyers were `` very *UNK* . '' STOP 
The outlook `` looks *UNK* because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off *UNKS* by individual investors , says King *CUNK* , senior vice president at *CUNK* , *CUNK* & *CUNK* , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services . STOP 
Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the *UNK* consecutive day Friday . STOP 
In a *UNK* contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 *UNKN* , its biggest gain of the year . STOP 
The bond 's yield dropped to *UNKN* % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to *CUNKAL* Data *CUNKAL* Markets Group . STOP 
The yield on three-month Treasury bills , considered the *UNKEST* of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to *UNKN* % , the largest *UNK-* decline since 1982 . STOP 
The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the *UNK-* drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . STOP 
`` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said *CUNK* *CUNK* , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . STOP 
Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead . STOP 
`` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says William Sullivan , director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , New York . STOP 
Any sustained *UNKING* could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . STOP 
Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at *CUNK* , *CUNK* & Co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high-yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic *UNK* -LCB- for the junk bond *UNK* -RCB- . STOP 
It was *UNK* *UNK* . '' STOP 
He adds : `` The junk market has *UNKED* some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets *UNKED* that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk . STOP 
I do n't believe that 's the case , but I believe that people are running scared . STOP 
There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . '' STOP 
Even as trading in high-yield issues *UNKED* up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion of new junk bonds . STOP 
For example , a recent $ *UNKN* million offering of *CUNK* Gas Services *CUNK* bonds sold by First Boston was three times *UNKED* . STOP 
A $ 550 million offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc . high-yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased $ 50 million because of strong demand . STOP 
First Boston estimates that in November and December alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest payments . STOP 
`` That 's a clear indication that there is and will be an *UNUNK* of basic business going on , '' says Mr. *CUNK* of First Boston . STOP 
`` I do n't know how people can say the junk bond market *UNKED* when there were $ 1.5 billion of orders for $ 550 million of junk bonds sold last week by Turner , '' says Raymond *CUNK* , *UNK-* of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co . STOP 
`` When the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will . STOP 
There is plenty of money available from people who want to buy *UNKED* deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a *UNKING* that people are wary of . '' STOP 
But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have *UNKED* this year , casting a *UNK* over much of the junk market . STOP 
Michael *CUNK* , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services , says the quality of junk issues has been getting *UNKER* , contributing to the slide in prices . STOP 
`` Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says . STOP 
`` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . STOP 
And our credit standards have n't changed one *UNK* . '' STOP 
However , Mr. *CUNK* said the slide in junk is creating `` one *UNK* of a buying opportunity '' for *UNK* buyers . STOP 
For the moment , investors seem more *UNKED* with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . STOP 
`` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by *CUNK* & York , says Mr. *CUNK* of Merrill Lynch . STOP 
`` That really affected the market in that people started to ask ` What else is in trouble ? ' '' STOP 
Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was *UNKING* through one of its worst years ever . STOP 
Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , *UNKED* by a seemingly *UNKS* trail of bad news : STOP 
-- In June , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion of *UNK* debt securities , New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. said it ran out of borrowed money . STOP 
-- In July , *CUNK* Corp. , the *CUNKED* real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law . STOP 
-- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and *UNK-* Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points . STOP 
-- In August , *CUNKS* International Inc. , which sold more than $ 500 million of junk bonds , suspended interest payments . STOP 
-- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , *CUNKS* Financial Corp. *UNKED* on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities . STOP 
*CUNK* , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of *UNKING* . STOP 
Moody 's says the *UNK* of corporate credit *UNKS* is the highest this year since 1982 . STOP 
In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . STOP 
`` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says James *CUNK* , editor of *CUNK* 's Interest *CUNK* *CUNKER* , an early critic of the junk bond market . STOP 
`` What we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying *UNK* compound interest . STOP 
*CUNKS* were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings . STOP 
What we 're seeing now is the *UNKING* *UNK* of asset values to a future when *UNK-* debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . '' STOP 
Friday 's Market Activity STOP 
Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a *UNKING* stock market . STOP 
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted 6 p.m. EDT at 103 *UNKN* , compared with 100 *UNKN* Thursday , up 2 1\/2 points . STOP 
The yield on the benchmark fell to *UNKN* % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to *CUNKAL* Data *CUNKAL* Markets Group . STOP 
The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a *OUS* fall in the stock market . STOP 
Treasurys opened lower , *UNKING* *UNKLY* to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- *UNKED* in September . STOP 
Bond prices barely *UNKED* until *UNK* . STOP 
Many bond market participants will be closely *UNKING* the action of the Federal Reserve , which might repeat its October 1987 *UNKION* of huge amounts of liquidity to *UNK* the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession . STOP 
Prices of *UNKS* , investment-grade *UNKS* and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts . STOP 
Mortgage securities rose in *UNK* trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . STOP 
The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue ended at 98 *UNKN* , up 7\/8 point on the day , to yield about *UNKN* % to a 12-year average life assumption . STOP 
*CUNK-* corporate bonds were up about 1\/2 to 3\/4 point . STOP 
But the yield spread between *UNK-* , investment-grade issues and *UNK-* bonds widened . STOP 
And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority . STOP 
Despite rumors that the TVA 's *UNKED* offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled . STOP 
One of the sources said the smaller *UNKS* of $ 750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially *UNKED* . '' STOP 
Municipal bonds rose as much as 3\/4 point . STOP 
Roger *CUNK* contributed to this article . STOP 
Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come *UNK* the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and *UNKS* have been put in place to keep markets more *UNKLY* . STOP 
Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was *UNKED* by Washington . STOP 
The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the *UNK* began immediately after the UAL trading halt . STOP 
Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one *UNKING* bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business . STOP 
This *UNKION* leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones *UNKER* shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in *UNKING* the capital gains tax cut . STOP 
The real value of all shares , after all , is directly *UNKED* by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- . STOP 
And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month . STOP 
An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut . STOP 
There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for *UNKING* the *UNK* out of the *UNKION* bill . STOP 
It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues *UNK-* on their individual *UNKS* without *UNK* . STOP 
For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an *UNK-* vote . STOP 
Since Senate leaders have so far *UNKED* it up with procedural *UNKS* , promises of a *UNKER* bill are suspect . STOP 
*CUNKLY* so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama *UNK* . STOP 
To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's *UNK* *UNKS* . STOP 
As the best opportunities for corporate *UNKS* are *UNKED* of course , at some point the market will start to reject them . STOP 
But the airlines are *UNKLY* a clear case , given *UNKER* *UNK* by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who *UNKS* to believe safety will be *UNKED* if *CUNK* and British Airways own interests in companies that fly *UNKS* . STOP 
*CUNK* , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner *UNK* . STOP 
James *CUNK* , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public *CUNKS* and Transportation Committee 's *UNKION* subcommittee , has put an *UNK-* takeover bill on *UNK* speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids . STOP 
It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more . STOP 
So the UAL deal has problems , and the market *UNKS* 190 points . STOP 
*CUNKS* , Mr. Secretary and Mr. *CUNK* . STOP 
In the 1987 crash , remember , the market was *UNK* by a *CUNK* *CUNK* proposal to tax takeovers out of *UNK* . STOP 
Even more important , in our view , was the Treasury 's threat to *UNK* the dollar . STOP 
The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; *UNKLY* , the dollar is not under *UNK-* pressure . STOP 
Also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling *UNKS* . STOP 
They are better *UNKED* . STOP 
They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape *UNKS* and clearing and settlement delays . STOP 
The Fed promises any needed liquidity . STOP 
The Big Board 's *UNK* with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea . STOP 
In any event , some traders see stocks as *UNKED* today , unlike 1987 . STOP 
There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be *UNKED* by a little *UNK* and common sense in Washington . STOP 
But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect . STOP 
First Chicago Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ *UNKN* million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans . STOP 
The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , said it set aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries . STOP 
The addition , on top of two big 1987 *UNKS* to *UNK-* reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of *UNK-* and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . STOP 
First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion . STOP 
Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital . STOP 
During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ *UNKN* million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment *CUNKS* unit . STOP 
*CUNKED* foreign exchange and bond trading profits *UNKED* 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ *UNKN* million from $ *UNKN* million . STOP 
*CUNKS* from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy-out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million from $ *UNKN* million a year ago . STOP 
Interest income and most fee income was strong . STOP 
Greece 's second *UNK* of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5 . STOP 
For those hoping to see a *UNK* of political *UNK* restored -- in view of Greece 's *UNK-* *UNK* under *UNK* *UNK* and subsequent three-month *UNK* with a *UNK-* coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still *UNKING* former Prime Minister *CUNKS* *CUNK* and his fallen socialist government are like *UNKS* *UNKING* around a *UNKING* *UNKS* . STOP 
In the *UNK-* round of voting , *CUNKS* gave no clear *UNK* to any single political party . STOP 
The ad interim coalition government that emerged from *UNKAL* *UNKS* was , in *UNK* , little more than the *UNKED* *UNKING* of *UNKAL* *UNKION* : On one side , the *UNK-* New *CUNK* Party , headed by *CUNK* *CUNKS* . STOP 
On the other , the so-called *CUNKION* of the *CUNK* and *CUNKS* -- a *UNK* and rather *UNK* title for a merger of the *UNK-* Communist Party of Greece and its *CUNK-* *UNK* , the *CUNK* *CUNK* . STOP 
The *UNKING* bond for this *UNK-* *UNK* was plain : *CUNK* -LRB- Mr. *CUNK* 's party -RRB- as common political *UNK* . STOP 
The *UNK* goal was a *UNK-* of government corruption , *UNKLY* at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. *CUNK* and his *UNKEST* associates . STOP 
In point of fact , this *UNKS* was *UNK* by decades . STOP 
When reduced to *UNK* status in *UNK* *UNK* *UNKS* , however , the notion *UNKED* into a promised *UNK* , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice . STOP 
With regard to Greece 's *UNKING* *UNKING* scandal , Mr. *CUNK* 's principal *UNKER* remains George *CUNKS* , former owner of the Bank of *CUNK* and *UNKED* *UNKER* , now *UNKING* in a jail cell in *CUNK* , Mass. , from where he is fighting *UNKION* proceedings that would return him to Greece . STOP 
Mr. *CUNKS* 's credibility is , at best , *UNK* . STOP 
He has *UNK* *UNK* to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than *UNK* on numerous points . STOP 
Nevertheless , the New *CUNK* and Communist parties *UNK* his *UNKS* as proof of *CUNK* *UNK* . STOP 
Among *UNKED* questions are whether Mr. *CUNK* received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of *CUNK* funds and an additional $ *UNKN* in *UNKS* , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. *CUNKS* 's bank and then *UNK* off the interest ; and , what *CUNK* 's cut was from the $ *UNKN* million Mr. *CUNKS* *UNKED* . STOP 
Two former ministers were so heavily *UNKED* in the *CUNKS* affair that *CUNK* members of Parliament voted to *UNKER* them to the special court . STOP 
But *UNKING* parliamentary probe was the case of millions of *UNKS* Mr. *CUNKS* *UNKED* into New *CUNK* *UNKS* . STOP 
In the end , the investigation produced only *UNKAL* evidence and `` indications '' that point to *CUNK* , not *UNKING* proof . STOP 
On another issue , *CUNKS* were told how their national intelligence agency , the *CUNK* , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and *CUNK* cabinet members . STOP 
Despite *UNKING* arguments , it was never established that Mr. *CUNK* personally ordered or directed the *UNKS* . STOP 
The central weakness of the `` scandals '' *UNKS* was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and *UNKS* . STOP 
The coalition government tried to show that *CUNK* ministers had received hefty *UNKS* for *CUNKING* the purchase of *CUNK-* *CUNKING* Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the *CUNKED* General Dynamics Corp. and France 's *CUNKS* *CUNK* *CUNK* , respectively . STOP 
*CUNKLY* , neither General Dynamics nor *CUNK* could be expected to *UNKER* its prospective future dealings by making *UNKS* of *UNKS* paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various *CUNK* officials for services *UNKED* . STOP 
So it seems that Mr. *CUNKS* and his communist *UNKS* may have *UNKLY* served Mr. *CUNK* a moral victory on a *UNKER* : *CUNK* , whether guilty or not , can now *UNK* the *UNK* *UNKING* the whole affair as a *UNK* *UNK* at Mr. *CUNK* 's expense . STOP 
But while *UNKAL* high *UNKS* alone wo n't help *CUNK* regain power , Mr. *CUNK* should never be *UNKED* . STOP 
First came his *UNK* *UNK* : He charged the *CUNKION* of the *CUNK* and *CUNKS* had sold out its *UNK* *UNKS* by *UNKING* in a *UNKING* plot aimed at *UNKING* *CUNK* and *UNKING* the course of socialism in Greece . STOP 
Then , to *UNKS* his credibility with the left , he *UNKED* some smaller *UNK* parties to stand for election under the *CUNK* *UNKER* . STOP 
Next , he continued to court the *UNKS* -- many of whom feel *UNKED* by the *UNK-* coalition 's *UNK* -- by bringing into *CUNK* a *UNKED* Communist Party candidate . STOP 
For balance , and in hopes of gaining some *UNKED* *UNK* votes , he managed to attract a former New *CUNK* Party representative and known political *UNK* of Mr. *CUNKS* . STOP 
Thus *CUNK* heads for the polls not only with diminished *UNK-* , but also with `` *UNKS* of approval '' from representatives of its *UNKEST* *UNKS* . STOP 
*CUNKAL* as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the *UNK* . STOP 
The country 's future NATO participation remains *UNUNK* , for instance . STOP 
Greece also must *UNK* major pieces of legislation in *UNKION* for the 1992 targets of *UNKED* *CUNK* Market cooperation . STOP 
Greece 's *UNKAL* relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well . STOP 
For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece *UNKS* in May 1990 . STOP 
*CUNKS* for a new agreement were *UNK* before the June elections , but the *UNK* is running . STOP 
Another matter of concern is the *UNKION* of *CUNKED* *CUNK* , a Palestinian *UNK* who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 *UNKING* of a Pan American Airways flight . STOP 
The *CUNK* courts have decided in favor of *UNKION* in the *CUNK* case , but the matter *UNKS* final approval from Greece 's next justice minister . STOP 
The *CUNKS* seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a *UNKS* test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism . STOP 
That *CUNK* could win the elections *UNK* is *UNK* ; the *CUNK* press , previously eager to *UNK* off *CUNK* 's line , has turned on Mr. *CUNK* with a *UNKED* *UNK* . STOP 
Yet the possibility of another *UNK-* government is all too real . STOP 
If Mr. *CUNK* becomes the major opposition leader , he could *UNKING* a *UNKED* coalition . STOP 
Also , he could force new elections early next year by *UNKING* the procedures for the election of the president of the *UNK* in March . STOP 
New *CUNK* has once again *UNKLY* *UNKED* the *UNK* and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against *CUNK* , *UNKING* to tend to either program *UNK* or the *UNKION* of internal *UNKS* . STOP 
As for Mr. *CUNK* ? STOP 
He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage . STOP 
But since he is *UNKLY* one of the most *UNK* *UNK* *UNKS* who ever *UNKED* *UNK* , it seems far *UNKER* to view him as *UNKED* , but certainly not yet eliminated . STOP

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials *UNK* for false sales projections on new products if the news media *UNKLY* *UNKED* substantial information about the product 's *UNKS* . STOP 
The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. , claiming that company officials *UNKED* investors about the expected success of the *CUNK* computer , introduced in 1983 . STOP 
Lawyers *UNKING* in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the `` press defense '' by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling . STOP 
According to the suit , Apple officials created public *UNK* by *UNKING* *CUNK* as an office computer that would *UNK* the *UNK* and be extremely successful in its first year . STOP 
The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the *UNK* , the company *UNKED* internal *UNKS* indicating problems with *CUNK* . STOP 
The suit claimed Apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ *UNKN* a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts . STOP 
But when the company *UNKED* *CUNK* 's poor sales late in 1983 , the stock plummeted to a low of $ *UNKN* a share , according to the suit . STOP 
The shareholders claimed more than $ 150 million in losses . STOP 
In 1987 , the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had *UNKLY* *UNKED* the company 's statements by *UNKING* consumers to *CUNK* 's problems . STOP 
Late last month , the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed . STOP 
However , it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that *UNKS* to *CUNK* 's disk drive , known as *CUNK* . STOP 
The court ruled that the news media did n't reveal *CUNK* 's problems at the time . STOP 
Lawyers are worried about the ruling 's *UNKION* in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court *UNKED* that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the Apple case . STOP 
`` The court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company 's statements , '' said Patrick *CUNK* , a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of *CUNK* & *CUNKS* , which was n't involved in the case . STOP

The federal appeals court held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims did n't exclude the *CUNK* from being *UNKED* . STOP 
*CUNK* laws provide that injured parties may be *UNKED* for lawyers ' fees . STOP

Mr. *CUNK* , of *CUNK* , *CUNKS* , *CUNK* , *CUNKER* & *CUNK* in New York , says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the *CUNK* lost its major claims , including its *UNKION* that the NFL *UNKED* trade through television contracts . STOP

The *UNK* among takeover stocks Friday does n't mean the end of *UNKS* but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game , Wall Street 's *UNK-* deal makers say . STOP 
*CUNKS* from now on are more likely to be *UNKED* companies , rather than *UNKS* or *UNK-* *UNKS* . STOP 
And they will be launching *UNKED* and perhaps fewer deals , now that it 's tougher to finance them . STOP 
This is an *OUS* sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale . STOP 
*CUNKER* the 1980s merger boom seems to be *UNKING* , shock waves *UNK* through the stock market . STOP 
`` The market is *UNKED* , not cheap , '' says Alan *CUNKS* of the New York *UNK-* firm *CUNKS* *CUNK* . STOP 
He recently began increasing his cash position to 45 % of his portfolio . STOP 
`` I look at where deals can get done , '' he says , `` and they 're not getting done '' at current prices . STOP 
*CUNKS* are growing increasingly nervous about *UNKED* takeovers , investment bankers say . STOP 
`` You had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond market that ran *UNK* into the news on Friday about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market , '' says Steven *CUNKER* , a partner and merger specialist with *CUNK* *CUNKS* & Co . STOP 
Trading *UNKED* up Friday in the market for high-yield junk bonds , often used to finance takeovers . STOP 
It was the latest in a series of *UNKS* for the junk bond market , where prices began weakening last month after Campeau hit a cash crunch . STOP 
And banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans . STOP 
The group trying to buy UAL announced Friday that it could n't *UNK* the $ 7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of United Airlines for $ 300 a share . STOP 
*CUNK-* traders today will be *UNKING* to learn of any UAL developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in *UNK* . STOP 
Investment bankers representing the buy-out group and UAL 's board spent a *UNK* weekend trying to *UNKER* out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks . STOP 
After UAL , the stock viewed as most vulnerable is American Airlines ' parent AMR , the target of a $ *UNK-* takeover proposal from New York real estate developer Donald Trump . STOP 
Trading in AMR shares was suspended shortly after 3 p.m. EDT Friday and did n't resume . STOP 
Before the halt , AMR last traded at 98 5\/8 . STOP 
Late Friday night , the London office of *CUNKS* & Co. , a Los Angeles securities firm , traded AMR shares at prices as low as 80 . STOP 
Similarly , Delta Air Lines and USAir Group dropped *UNKN* % and 8.5 % , respectively , on Friday and could weaken further . STOP 
Over the *UNKED* , however , two developments in other deals indicated that *UNKAL* banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to *UNK* billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies . STOP 
*CUNK* S.A. , a major Mexican glass maker , said yesterday that it agreed to buy *CUNK* Glass *CUNKER* in a tender offer for $ *UNKN* a share , sweetened from the original $ *UNK-* offer *CUNK* launched two months ago . STOP 
On Friday , *CUNK* shares fell 1 1\/4 to close at 18 1\/2 . STOP 
For the broader market , the greatest *UNK* of the *CUNK-* deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market *UNK* -- and involves a $ 155 million temporary `` bridge '' loan from Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a $ *UNKN* million loan from Security Pacific National Bank . STOP 
Moreover , to complete the entire *CUNK* Glass purchase and *UNK* existing debt , Donaldson said it is `` highly confident '' that it will be able to sell $ 400 million of junk bonds for *CUNK* , despite the current disarray in the junk bond market . STOP 
Donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle *UNK* , because those bonds will have to be sold before Donaldson 's bridge loan can be paid back . STOP 
Security Pacific , meanwhile , said it expects to *UNK* $ *UNKN* million in bank loans for *CUNK* . STOP 
In another takeover battle , a spokesman for McCaw Cellular Communications said yesterday that McCaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain `` highly confident '' they can *UNK* $ 4.5 billion of bank loans for McCaw 's tender offer for about 45 % of LIN Broadcasting , `` *UNKING* recent events . '' STOP 
McCaw is offering $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares , thereby challenging LIN 's proposal to spin off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ *UNK-* special dividend and combine its *UNK-* operations with BellSouth 's cellular business . STOP 
On Friday , LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping 5 1\/2 , or 4.9 % , to close at 107 1\/2 . STOP 
Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares were n't hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a *UNKED* corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by *UNKS* among bankers or bond buyers . STOP 
Investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver *UNKING* for the merger business in the stock-market drop . STOP 
*CUNKAL* bidders for companies `` were saying that things were beginning to look expensive , '' says Mr. *CUNKER* of *CUNK* . STOP 
`` Nothing makes things look cheaper than a *UNK-* drop in the Dow , '' Mr. *CUNKER* says . STOP 
`` Just as there are people waiting to become bargain *UNKS* in the stock market , there are people waiting to become bargain *UNKS* in the deal market . '' STOP 
Investment bankers expect most of those bargain *UNKS* to be *UNKED* corporations . STOP 
`` In the past , corporate buyers were often *UNKED* from making bids because of competition from LBO firms , which were often prepared to *UNK* '' the corporations , says J. *CUNK* Hill , head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton . STOP 
Now , `` corporate buyers should be willing to *UNKER* the acquisition market because the competition from *UNKED* buyers has been reduced . '' STOP 
Many takeover stocks plunged Friday , as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the *UNKED* *UNKER* stocks , the targets of rumored deals . STOP 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment , which has agreed to a friendly $ *UNK-* bid from Sony of Japan , fell only 1\/8 to close at 26 5\/8 . STOP 
But several stocks long rumored to be *UNK* for a takeover or restructuring fell 10 % or more . STOP 
They include USX , down *UNKN* % ; *CUNK* , down *UNKN* % ; *CUNK* *CUNK* , down 11 % ; Paramount Communications , off *UNKN* % ; *CUNK* , down *UNKN* % ; Delta Air Lines , down *UNKN* % , and MCA , down 9.7 % . STOP 
The market -- and investment bankers -- are even less *UNK* about companies that have had at least one bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already . STOP 
Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again . STOP 
*CUNKS* include *CUNK* , whose agreement to be acquired for $ 25 a share by *CUNK* collapsed last month . STOP 
*CUNK* shares fell nearly 20 % on Friday to close at 12 7\/8 . STOP 
Ramada , which first delayed and then *UNKED* a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell 15.6 % to close at 9 1\/2 . STOP 
Ramada has said it hopes to *UNK* a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so . STOP 
Shares of American Medical International , which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes First Boston Corp. and the *CUNKER* family of Chicago , fell *UNKN* % on Friday to close at 20 . STOP 
The buy-out group is offering $ *UNKN* a share for 63 million American Medical shares , down from its offer in July of $ 28 a share for *UNKN* million shares . STOP 
But investment bankers say the market may have *UNK* some *UNKED* stocks . STOP 
*CUNK* *CUNKS* , for example , was among the *UNK-* issues , falling *UNKN* % to close at 85 , down 21 1\/2 on Friday . STOP 
*CUNK* currently is *UNKING* bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses . STOP 
People familiar with *CUNK* said over the weekend that the *UNK* of the sell-off in *CUNK* shares was *UNKED* because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing . STOP 
However , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group *UNKED* a general *UNKS* among banks to provide credit for *UNKED* takeovers . STOP 
*CUNK* officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock . STOP 
William *CUNK* , *CUNK* 's general counsel , said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and *UNK* process . '' STOP 
`` I ca n't believe that any potential buyer for *CUNK* would be affected by one day 's trading , '' Mr. *CUNK* said . STOP 
But the stock market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further *UNK* by takeover *UNKS* , both in the *UNK* market and among commercial banks . STOP 
For *UNK-* *UNKS* , `` the takeover game has been over for some time , '' says New York money manager *CUNK* *CUNK* of *CUNK* Capital , who has been keeping 85 % of his portfolio in cash . STOP 
`` The market is just *UNKING* up to that point . '' STOP 
*CUNK* *CUNK* in Los Angeles contributed to this column . STOP 
Of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease . STOP 
To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms . STOP 
It must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective . STOP 
*CUNKLY* , it must understand how real-estate markets *UNK* to *UNKS* in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities . STOP 
When a regional economy *UNKS* cold , the local real-estate market gets *UNK* . STOP 
In other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , *UNK* much further than a local economy in recession . STOP 
This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the *UNKS* in New York . STOP 
But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy *UNKS* from a slowdown , these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy . STOP 
Why do local real-estate markets *UNK* to regional economic cycles ? STOP 
Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth . STOP 
Metropolitan Detroit was written off *UNKLY* during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales *UNKION* and adjustment . STOP 
Area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % . STOP 
However , the real-estate market was hurt even more . STOP 
For example , residential building permits in the *UNK* year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level . STOP 
Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the *UNKS* , real estate rebounded . STOP 
Building permits , for example , soared a *UNKING* 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 . STOP 
Where , *UNK* corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ? STOP 
*CUNK* no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , *UNK* and potentially *UNKED* real-estate markets in the nation . STOP 
Of course , some observers have *UNKED* Houston and Denver for the past five years as a *UNKAL* play . STOP 
But now appears to be the time to act . STOP 
Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then *UNK* in the years after its 1982 peak . STOP 
In the *UNKS* , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % . STOP 
The real-estate market suffered even more severe *UNKS* . STOP 
Office construction dropped 97 % . STOP 
The vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant . STOP 
To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's `` *UNK-* *UNK* '' were *UNK* of a very troubled economy . STOP 
As usual , the real-estate market had *UNKED* . STOP 
*CUNKLY* , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation . STOP 
Metropolitan Houston 's population has held steady over the past six years . STOP 
And personal income , after *UNKING* in the *UNKS* , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms . STOP 
Today , metropolitan Houston 's real-estate market is *UNKED* for a significant turnaround . STOP 
More than *UNKN* jobs were added in *UNK* Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry . STOP 
This growth puts Houston in the top five *UNK* areas in the nation last year . STOP 
And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average . STOP 
Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has *UNKED* to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston . STOP 
By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years . STOP 
Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle . STOP 
*CUNK* is now 4 % higher than in 1983 . STOP 
Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 -LRB- the most recent year available -RRB- . STOP 
The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy . STOP 
In a *UNKING* *UNK* , therefore , the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years . STOP 
Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 *UNKS* . STOP 
Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real-estate market will rebound , major public works projects *UNKING* several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major *UNK* *UNKING* the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport . STOP 
When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting *UNKION* of real-estate activity will *UNK* the general economic rebound . STOP 
What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ? STOP 
*CUNKLY* , *UNK* in commercial real estate is dropping from its *UNKS* peak , even in such *UNKLY* healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles . STOP 
*CUNK* rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to *UNK-* % range in a couple of years . STOP 
Under these conditions , even a *UNKING* out of economic growth -- `` *UNKING* cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for *UNKS* as the *UNK* industry *UNKS* *UNK* . STOP 
Those looking for real-estate *UNKS* in *UNKED* metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term -LRB- three-year -RRB- lease and wait for the *UNKS* ahead . STOP 
Mr. *CUNKER* is managing partner of a real-estate advisory firm based in Beverly Hills , Calif . STOP 
*CUNK* Industrial Corp. said it expects its third-quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share , compared with 61 cents a share a year ago . STOP 
Analysts had been *UNKING* that the company 's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents a share . STOP 
The year-earlier third-quarter earnings amounted to $ 4.1 million . STOP 
The company said a drop in activity in the *UNK* industry reduced sales volume at its two *UNKED* operations . STOP 
Also , the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts . STOP 
*CUNK* , a maker of *UNK-* truck and commercial *UNKION* equipment , said it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share . STOP 
*CUNK* *CUNK* asked both the Senate *CUNKS* Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political *UNKS* by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who *UNKED* with *UNK-* regulators for him . STOP 
Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal *UNKING* lawsuit *UNKING* him of *UNKING* off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into *UNK* . STOP 
*CUNKED* *CUNKER* -- president of *CUNK* *CUNK* , the *UNKED* citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic *CUNK* Dennis *CUNK* of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald *CUNK* of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John *CUNK* of Arizona . STOP 
Mr. *CUNKER* based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . STOP 
I want to say in the most *UNK* way I can : I certainly hope so . '' STOP 
In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. *CUNK* 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln . STOP 
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling *UNKLY* with *UNKS* ' federally insured money and was `` a *UNKING* time *UNK* . '' STOP 
Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too *OUS* . STOP 
The notes show that Sen. *CUNK* called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` *UNKLY* unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . '' STOP 
For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time was the agency responsible for *UNKING* thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal *UNKS* warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent . STOP 
Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day . STOP 
The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15 . STOP 
Mr. Keating has filed his own suit , *UNKING* that his property was taken illegally . STOP 
The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2.5 billion . STOP 
*CUNKS* of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers . STOP 
In the midst of his 1988 *UNKION* campaign , Sen. *CUNK* , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , returned $ *UNKN* in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators . STOP 
Sen. *CUNK* , after months of *UNKING* off intense press criticism , returned $ *UNKN* only last month , shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of *UNKING* Lincoln . STOP 
In addition , Sen. *CUNK* last week disclosed that he *UNKLY* had paid $ *UNKN* to American Continental as *UNK* for trips he and his family took *UNK* the corporate jet to Mr. Keating 's *UNKION* home at *CUNK* *CUNK* , the *CUNKS* , from 1984 through 1986 . STOP 
Sen. *CUNK* said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the *UNKS* . '' STOP 
Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ *UNKN* to Sen. *CUNK* 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts . STOP 
But Sen. *CUNK* says Mr. Keating broke off their *UNK* *UNKLY* in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as *UNKLY* as Mr. Keating wanted . STOP 
`` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a *UNK* , '' Sen. *CUNK* recalls . STOP 
In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ *UNKN* in corporate funds to three tax-exempt *UNKER* registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the *UNKEST* of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that *UNKING* the money was `` a pretty *UNK* thing to do politically . '' STOP 
In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ *UNKN* in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ *UNKN* in corporate donations for a 1986 *UNK-* drive that benefited the senator 's *UNKION* campaign that year . STOP 
Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn . STOP 
That was in addition to $ *UNKN* in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator . STOP 
Mr. *CUNKER* said the Senate *CUNKS* Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright . STOP 
Wilson *CUNK* , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment . STOP 
Sen. *CUNK* said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . '' STOP 
Sen. *CUNK* said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be *UNKER* , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a *UNK* . STOP 
Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate *CUNKS* Committee . '' STOP 
Sen. *CUNK* said , `` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully *UNKED* . '' STOP 
Sen. Cranston , who had already *UNKED* his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , *UNKED* his role in 1987 as *UNKING* regulators to act . STOP 
`` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner ? '' he said . STOP 
`` That is what *CUNK* *CUNK* should ask be *UNKED* . STOP 
*CUNK* Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1,000 coal *UNK* cars for Norfolk Southern Corp . STOP 
*CUNK* estimated the value of the pact at more than $ 40 million . STOP 
*CUNK* said it plans to begin delivery of the *UNK* cars in the first quarter of 1990 . STOP 
It said the 1,000 *UNK* cars are in addition to the *UNKN* coal *UNK* cars *UNKLY* being produced for Norfolk Southern , a Norfolk , *CUNKED* railroad concern . STOP 
When China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 , toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first to *UNK* in . STOP 
Today , with about 75 % of the companies ' products being made in China , the chairman of the Hong Kong *CUNKS* Council , Dennis *CUNKING* , has suggested a new *UNKING* label : `` *CUNK* in China by Hong Kong Companies . '' STOP 
The toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony . STOP 
But in the wake of the *UNKS* in Beijing on June 4 , the Hong Kong toy industry is *UNKING* about its strong *UNK* on China . STOP 
Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by China 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites . STOP 
The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , *UNK* uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies . STOP 
`` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David *CUNK* , chairman and chief executive officer of International *CUNK* Group Ltd . STOP 
Indeed , *CUNK* and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in *CUNK* Asia , especially in *CUNK* , long before the massacre . STOP 
Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China . STOP 
By *UNKING* supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say . STOP 
It would n't be easy to *UNK* quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade . STOP 
A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's *UNK* , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's *CUNK* province a premier manufacturing site . STOP 
`` South China is the most competitive source of *UNKS* in the world , '' says Henry *CUNK* , executive director of *CUNK* *CUNKING* *CUNKS* Consolidated Ltd . STOP 
Hong Kong trade figures *UNK* the toy makers ' *UNK* on factories across the border . STOP 
In 1988 , exports of *UNKLY* produced *UNKS* and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to *CUNK* *UNKN* billion -LRB- US$ *UNKN* billion -RRB- . STOP 
But *UNKS* , mainly from China , jumped 75 % , to *CUNK* *UNKN* billion . STOP 
In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to *CUNK* *UNKN* billion , while *UNKS* rose 56 % , to *CUNK* *UNKN* billion . STOP 
Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China , where an estimated *UNKN* people are employed by the toy industry . STOP 
`` For the next few years , like it or not , China is going to be the main supplier , '' says *CUNK* Young , vice president of *CUNK* Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border . STOP 
In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on *CUNK* Asia . STOP 
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in *CUNK* , including *CUNK* , *CUNK* *CUNKING* and *CUNKER* Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. *CUNKING* . STOP 
Malaysia , the Philippines and *CUNK* also are being studied . STOP 
With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , *CUNKAL* and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . STOP 
*CUNKS* about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , *CUNKS* of *CUNKER* Inc. and *CUNK* Industries Inc . STOP 
Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt *UNKS* and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties *UNKED* the local industry , causing it to *UNK* credit policies and financial management . STOP 
The industry *UNKS* last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results . STOP 
Still , they long for a `` *UNK-* '' toy to *UNK* retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for *UNKS* and games . STOP 
The *UNKEST* thing the colony 's companies have to a U.S. *UNK-* this year is the *CUNK* *CUNK* *CUNK* *CUNKS* series of action figures manufactured by *CUNKS* Holdings Ltd . STOP 
*CUNKED* in *UNK-* , the *UNK-* plastic *UNKS* are based on an American comic book and television series . STOP 
Paul *CUNK* , managing director of *CUNKS* , says 10 million *CUNK* *CUNKS* have been sold , *UNKING* the *UNK* *UNKS* among the 10 *UNKING* *UNKS* in the U.S. . STOP 
Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. *CUNK* said the *CUNK* *CUNKS* could make 1989 a record sales year for *CUNKS* . STOP 
Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 . STOP 
Besides the lack of a *UNKING* product , they *UNK* the continued *UNK* of the U.S. market by *CUNK* Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by *CUNK* Co. of Japan . STOP 
*CUNK* buyers have little money left to spend on other products . STOP 
Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of *UNKED* infrastructure and Beijing 's *UNK* programs launched late last year . STOP 
*CUNK* makers complain that electricity in *CUNK* has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid *UNKION* has *UNKED* its *UNKING* capacity . STOP 
Manufacturers are *UNKING* *UNK* power plants . STOP 
Bank credit for China investments all but *UNKED* up following June 4 . STOP 
Also , concern *UNKS* that the *UNK-* Beijing leadership will *UNK* its control of *CUNK* , which has been the main laboratory for the *UNK-* policy and economic reforms . STOP 
But , toy manufacturers and other *UNKS* say Beijing will be *UNKED* from *UNKING* controls on *UNKED* southern China . STOP 
They say China 's trade deficit is *UNKING* and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to *UNKER* production in *CUNK* . STOP 
`` The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. *CUNK* of *CUNKS* . STOP 
The Bush administration , urging the Supreme Court to give states more *UNK* to restrict abortions , said *UNKS* have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents . STOP 
*CUNK* General Kenneth *CUNK* argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision , *CUNK* vs. *CUNK* , *UNKING* a constitutional right to abortion , was *UNK* . STOP 
He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that *UNKS* have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely *UNKED* by their parents . STOP 
The administration 's position was *UNKED* in a *UNK-* brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term . STOP 
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion . STOP 
The administration urged the *UNKS* to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William *CUNK* last July when the high court *UNK* Missouri 's abortion restrictions . STOP 
Under that standard , which *UNKED* the votes of only three of the nine *UNKS* , a state *UNKION* of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' *UNKION* for *UNKING* it . STOP 
That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` *UNKING* '' reason for *UNKING* abortion . STOP 
On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows *UNKS* to go to court for a judge 's permission instead . STOP 
The case , *CUNK* vs. Minnesota , will be argued Nov. 29 . STOP 
*CUNK* Co. of America , hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas , said net income for the third quarter dropped *UNKN* % to $ *UNKN* million , or $ *UNKN* a share . STOP 
The nation 's No. 1 aluminum maker earned $ *UNKN* million , or $ *UNKN* a share , a year earlier . STOP 
Revenue rose 11 % to $ *UNKN* billion from $ *UNKN* billion . STOP 
Analysts , who were expecting *CUNK* to post around $ *UNKN* to $ 3 a share , were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results . STOP 
`` It 's disappointing , '' said William *CUNK* , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co . STOP 
Much of the earnings decline was led by *UNK-* rate adjustments , which affected the bottom line by $ *UNKN* million , or 17 cents a share , compared with $ 3.6 million , or four cents a share , the previous year . STOP 
*CUNKER* prices for aluminum *UNKS* and certain *UNK* products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said . STOP 
`` In addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant *UNKS* for *UNKION* work , '' the company said . STOP 
Excluding the higher tax rate , which rose two percentage points to 38 % , and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the company would have met analysts ' expectations , said R. Wayne *CUNK* , an analyst with Goldman , Sachs & Co . STOP 
*CUNKING* that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's *UNKEST* , Mr. *CUNK* added , `` the third quarter is never a *UNK* up period for them anyway . '' STOP 
Nevertheless , the company said shipments were up slightly to *UNKN* metric tons from *UNKN* , *UNKING* the impact of the unexpected earning decline . STOP 
The results were announced after the stock market closed . STOP 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , *CUNK* closed at $ 72 a share , down $ *UNKN* , in a sharply lower market . STOP 
For 20 years , federal rules have *UNKED* the three major television networks from *UNKING* in one of the most lucrative and *UNKING* parts of the television business . STOP 
And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood *UNKS* in a *UNK* attempt to change that . STOP 
But with foreign companies *UNKING* up U.S. movie *UNKS* , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever . STOP 
They hope the foreign deals will *UNK* the Hollywood opposition and *UNK* Congress to push for ending federal rules that *UNK* the networks from *UNKING* a piece of *UNK* sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air . STOP 
Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the *UNKS* -- is highly *UNK* any time soon . STOP 
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to *UNK* the `` *UNK-* '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and *CUNKION* *CUNKS* . STOP 
That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed by the deep *UNKS* of parent General Electric Co. , had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's *UNKED* $ 1.5 billion bid for MGM\/UA Communications Co . STOP 
NBC 's interest may revive the deal , which MGM\/UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash . STOP 
Even if that deal is n't revived , NBC hopes to find another . STOP 
`` Our doors are open , '' an NBC spokesman says . STOP 
NBC may yet find a way to take a *UNK* , minority interest in a *UNKER* without violating the rules . STOP 
And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC 's parent , Capital *CUNK* Inc. , to look for ways of *UNKING* the *UNK-* regulations . STOP 
But the networks ' push may only *UNK* an increasingly bitter *UNK* between them and Hollywood *UNKS* . STOP 
Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing *UNK-* *UNKS* . STOP 
Few people *UNK* to the talks expect the *UNKS* to *UNK* . STOP 
The networks still are `` *UNKED* in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges *CUNKION* *CUNK* Association President Jack *CUNK* , the most *OUS* *UNK* of *UNKING* the rules . STOP 
*CUNKS* are `` *UNKS* '' to get shows in prime-time *UNKS* and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative *UNK* sales , he contends . STOP 
And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says . STOP 
*CUNK* executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , *CUNKS* Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed . STOP 
But Mr. *CUNK* , who represents the *UNKS* , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of *UNKING* '' the rules . STOP 
Such *UNKS* leave network officials all the more *UNK* that the *UNKS* will *UNK* . STOP 
`` They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , '' says one network executive . STOP 
`` And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules . STOP 
That 's the problem , is n't it ? '' STOP 
Indeed it is . STOP 
Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the *UNKS* and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the *UNKS* , to work out their own compromise . STOP 
But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more *UNK* that the networks must be *UNKED* to survive . STOP 
The latest *UNKION* : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million . STOP 
`` I wonder what Walter *CUNK* will think of the *CUNK* *CUNK* System *CUNK* *CUNKING* News with Dan Rather broadcast *UNKLY* from Tokyo , '' wrote *CUNK* *CUNK* , an NBC vice president , in a *UNK* in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine . STOP 
In his article , Mr. *CUNK* , who was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` *UNK* *UNKS* '' in *UNK-* rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the *UNKS* by non-U.S. enterprises . STOP 
'' -LRB- He did n't mention that NBC , in the meantime , was hoping to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying STOP 
An NBC spokesman *UNKS* that Mr. *CUNK* 's *UNK* was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of *UNKED* deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . '' STOP 
The Big Three 's *UNK* for deregulation began *UNKING* in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner . STOP 
Although Time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely *UNKED* *UNK-* channel , Home *CUNK* Office , own the Warner movies *UNKED* on HBO -- a *UNKAL* integration that is effectively blocked by *UNK-* regulations . STOP 
NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in *UNKING* the networks ' *UNK* to match a *CUNKER* combination . STOP 
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced . STOP 
Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM\/UA was disclosed , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment . STOP 
With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into *UNKED* territory -- possibly raising *UNKS* at the *UNKS* and in Washington . STOP 
`` It 's never really been tested , '' says William *CUNK* III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted . STOP 
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies . STOP 
*CUNK-* rules do n't *UNKLY* block a network from buying a *UNK* , small stake in a company that profits from the *UNK* *UNKION* networks ca n't enjoy . STOP 
*CUNK* , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM\/UA . STOP 
If the transaction raised *UNKS* , the studio 's *UNKION* operations could be *UNK* off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake . STOP 
But such *UNKS* would still block the networks from *UNKING* a big chunk of the *UNKS* of *UNKION* . STOP 
Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a *UNKED* series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular *UNK* `` *CUNKING* '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the *UNKS* are sold to local stations . STOP 
Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee . STOP 
The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are *UNK* -- for several years at the least . STOP 
*CUNK* years ago they were *UNKLY* close . STOP 
The *CUNK-* Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules . STOP 
*OUS* evidence , including a *CUNKS* *CUNKION* study of some 800 series that the networks had *UNKED* and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't *UNK* *UNUNK* control over the *UNKS* as had been alleged . STOP 
But just eight days before the rules were to die , former President Ronald Reagan , a one-time actor , *UNKED* on behalf of Hollywood . STOP 
The FCC effort collapsed . STOP 
The networks and *UNKS* have *UNKED* ever since . STOP 
Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign *UNK* *UNKS* more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely . STOP 
In Congress , the issue *UNKS* : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives *UNKING* the issue . STOP 
A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. *CUNK* -LRB- *CUNK-* -RRB- , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC , says Mr. *CUNK* feels `` the world has been forever changed by the *CUNK-* deal . '' STOP 
But he said Mr. *CUNK* hopes this *UNKS* the networks and *UNKS* to work it out on their own . STOP 
And at the FCC , meanwhile , new Chairman Alfred C. *CUNKS* has said he wants the two sides to *UNKER* out their own plan . STOP 
Recognition Equipment Inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the U.S. *CUNKAL* Service . STOP 
The government sued the company in April , seeking $ *UNKN* and other unspecified damages related to an alleged *UNKING* scheme . STOP 
The suit named the company , former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr. , former vice president Robert W. *CUNK* and five defendants who were n't part of the company . STOP 
The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. *CUNKS* , an *UNKER* of the *CUNKAL* Service board of *UNKS* , to accept $ *UNKN* in *UNKS* , *UNKS* and *UNKS* . STOP 
Mr. *CUNKS* was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ *UNKN* for his role in the scheme . STOP 
In the agreement , Recognition agreed to pay the government $ 20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company , Mr. Moore and Mr. *CUNK* . STOP 
The five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement . STOP 
A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia . STOP 
They were indicted last October on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ 400 million in *CUNKAL* Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment . STOP 
The company and its executives deny the charges . STOP 
In a related development , Recognition Equipment said the *CUNKAL* Service has *UNKED* the company from bidding on *UNKAL* contracts for an additional 120 days . STOP 
The *CUNKAL* Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been renewing the ban ever since . STOP 
The company said it will continue to pursue a *UNKING* of the suspension . STOP 
Intel Corp. reported a 50 % drop in third-quarter net income , partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations . STOP 
The big semiconductor and computer maker , said it had net of $ 72 million , or 38 cents , down 50 % from $ *UNKN* million , or 78 cents a share . STOP 
The lower net included a charge of $ 35 million , equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis , for the cost of *UNKING* a *UNKS* joint venture with *CUNKS* AG of West Germany . STOP 
*CUNKING* also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing *UNK* demand . STOP 
Sales amounted to $ *UNKN* million , down 1.7 % from $ *UNKN* million . STOP 
Intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday , as investors appeared *UNKED* that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ *UNKN* million , or 53 cents a share , and that sales actually exceeded the $ *UNKN* million for the second period . STOP 
But Intel later *UNKED* to the stock market 's plunge , closing at $ *UNKN* , down $ *UNKN* . STOP 
In August , Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down '' from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its *UNKN* *UNK* , start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new *UNKN* chip in the current quarter . STOP 
On Friday , Andrew *CUNK* , Intel president and chief executive officer , said `` Intel 's business is strong . STOP 
Our *UNKS* improved as the quarter *UNKED* and September was especially good . STOP 
For the full quarter , our *UNKS* were higher than the previous quarter , and our *UNK-* ratio exceeded *UNKN* . '' STOP 
For the nine-month period , Intel reported net of $ *UNKN* million , or $ *UNKN* a share , down 27 % from $ *UNKN* million , or $ *UNKN* a share . STOP 
Revenue amounted to $ *UNKN* billion , up slightly from $ *UNKN* billion . STOP 
Walter *CUNK* and the African National Congress came home yesterday . STOP 
After 26 years in prison , Mr. *CUNK* , the *UNK-* former *UNKAL* of the *UNKION* movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the *UNK* was coming up . STOP 
At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in *UNKN* and sentenced to life *UNK* , were *UNKED* with their families at various places around the country . STOP 
And as the *UNKING* men returned to their homes , the ANC , *UNKED* in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public *UNK* by the white government , *UNKLY* returned to the streets of the country 's black *UNKS* . STOP 
A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold *UNKS* , was *UNKED* over the *UNK* *UNK* at Mr. *CUNK* 's modest house , while on the street out front , *UNKS* *UNKED* the ANC *UNKS* on their *UNKS* , *UNKS* and *UNKS* . STOP 
At the small *UNK-* home of *CUNKS* *CUNK* , a leading ANC *UNUNK* and a former *UNKER* in the group 's *UNKED* *UNKING* , *CUNK* we *CUNK* , *UNKS* stuck little ANC *UNKS* in their hair and a man *UNKED* on an *UNK* *UNK* *UNKED* in ANC *UNKS* . STOP 
`` I am happy to see the spirit of the people , '' said Mr. *CUNK* , looking *UNKER* in a new gray suit . STOP 
As the crowd outside his home *UNKED* `` ANC , ANC , '' the old man shot his *UNKS* into the air . STOP 
`` I 'm inspired by the mood of the people . '' STOP 
Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in *CUNK* , *CUNK* . STOP 
But the *UNUNK* release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and *UNKAL* core of the ANC , is a de *UNK* *UNKING* of the movement and the *UNK* of its internal *UNKING* . STOP 
`` The government can never put the ANC back into the *UNK* again , '' said *CUNK* *CUNK* , a veteran *UNK-* activist on hand to welcome Mr. *CUNK* . STOP 
`` *CUNKS* have gone too far for the government to stop them now . STOP 
There 's no turning back . '' STOP 
There was certainly no *UNKING* the *UNK* of ANC *UNKION* last night , when hundreds of people *UNKED* into the *CUNKLY* Cross *CUNK* Church in *CUNK* for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years . STOP 
*CUNKING* *UNKS* of `` ANC '' and `` *CUNK* we *CUNK* '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial *UNKION* on all *UNKS* , including the *UNKED* struggle . STOP 
And they called on the government to release Nelson *CUNK* , the ANC 's leading figure , who was *UNKED* with them and remains in prison . STOP 
Without him , said Mr. *CUNK* , the *UNKING* of the others `` is only a *UNK-* . '' STOP 
President *CUNK* de *CUNK* released the ANC men -- along with one of the *UNKING* members of the Pan *CUNK* Congress , a rival *UNKION* group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new *UNKION* aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government . STOP 
But *CUNK* may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this *UNKLY* divided country . STOP 
As other *UNK* governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . STOP 
As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued *UNK* of Mr. *CUNK* as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . STOP 
If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to *UNK* and *UNKEST* . STOP 
If it does , the large number of *UNKING* whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their *UNKION* and threats to take matters into their own hands . STOP 
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure . STOP 
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the *UNKS* leads to increased *UNK-* protests and violence ; if it does , *CUNK* will use this as a reason to keep Mr. *CUNK* behind *UNKS* . STOP 
*CUNK* has n't *UNK* why they were all sentenced to life *UNK* in the first place : for *UNK* and conspiracy to *UNK* the government . STOP 
In addition , the government is *UNKING* that the releases could create a split between the internal and *UNKAL* *UNKS* of the ANC and between the newly *UNKED* leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their *UNK* . STOP 
In order to head off any divisions , Mr. *CUNK* , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , *UNKED* them to report to the ANC headquarters in *CUNK* as soon as possible . STOP 
The men also will be faced with *UNKING* the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many *UNK* black *UNKS* , the so-called young *UNKS* who are anxious to see the old *UNKS* in action . STOP 
Says Peter *CUNK* , president of the South African *CUNK* Congress : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . '' STOP 
They never considered themselves to be anything else . STOP 
At last night 's rally , they called on their *UNKS* to be firm , yet *UNKED* , in their opposition to apartheid . STOP 
`` We *UNK* discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said Andrew *CUNK* , another early *CUNK* leader who is now 63 . STOP 
`` We want to see Nelson *CUNK* and all our *UNKS* out of prison , and if we are n't *UNKED* we may not see them here with us . STOP
